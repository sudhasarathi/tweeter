# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Create a tweet! Post it! View existing tweets in reverse-chronological order. Character counter ensures tweets stay within the alotted amount. Error messages will inform the user if their tweet conforms to the expected standard. Responsive layout keeps the site usable from smart phones to large displays.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.
